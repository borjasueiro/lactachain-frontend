# Android Lactachain Application
This project has been created as a master's thesis at the University of Coruña. 
```
The dairy sector seeks to offer mechanisms with a quality certification of the products produced in our farms, both at the level of quality standards of the raw material, as well as the production characteristics or the ethical context associated with it. The importation of milk has forced the dairy industry to look for different methods to give added value to the product to be sold. This master’s thesis aims to offer, through the latest traceability technologies, a seal of quality, providing clear and transparent information on the origin and the different locations and processes through which the material passes until it leaves the processing plant. The tool to be developed contemplate in its design the entire dairy production chain, although it focus essentially on traceability associated with three data sources. The first of these is related to the storage of milk by the farmer in the relevant storage silos. The second source of traceability data is associated with the collection of the raw material by the transporter, who takes the milk from origin to the processing plant. The last trace is collected at the plant, where the milk is processed. Each of the aforementioned data sources result in a record where different information stored. The blockchain-based system store data of interest related to the most
important aspects in the whole dairy chain.
